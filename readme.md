# Labs - My public experiments

This is the public version of my 'labs' repository where I experiment with different ideas that aren't big enough to warrant their own repo.

### Projects
 - <b> [Generalized Gesture Controller:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emmg5ml9Tp8) </b> Uses a combination of landmark tracking and gesture recognition to control a gimbal attached to the underside of a drone.
 - <b> [Dr. Strange Style Gesture Controller:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZIeA8BqUD8) </b> A more specialized version of the generalized controller, it's designed for on/off control of actuators or other single input use cases with it's visual design inspired by Marvel's Dr. Strange.
 - <b> [Apriltag Images:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf6D1qOmS5Y) </b> Overlays an image on an Apriltag depending on the tag's ID.
 - <b> [Robotic Hand Mimicry:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecAjy_f4md0) </b> Uses landmark tracking to copy the pose of the detected hand onto an Arduino-controlled robotic hand.
